    summary:
      'Brighton Beach is a Russian community neighbourhood in New York. When I was growing up in Moscow as a kid I’ve heard a lot about it on TV: the magical place where one can become and live like an American. During the early 90s, there was an obsession with everything USA; it suddenly became “amazing and wonderful”, instead of “the villain” — a narrative it was given for over fifty years prior. Perestroika flipped the entire culture onto its head.',

That’s typically enough for us to buy tickets and fly to a place that’s on the same continent. Which we did.',

A photograph is a piece of art created by sifting physical reality through the creative tendencies of a human being and some amount of physical process depending on the medium.

Whilst some could argue that would be a good thing, it would certainly be a very different world. One of the next great leaps forward was the mechanisation of farming. Levers played a major part in the control of this process, and indeed levers are a wonderful metaphor for the transition of our species away from the earth and towards their own destiny. Truly Humankind generally believes that they are separate from the earth and able to exist without considering it. Workers of the land know differently, our future and that of the land are inextricably joined and levers that act upon it also act upon ourselves.',

So far we’ve visited eleven countries. Vietnam was one of our favourites — spent around three months there. China is where Betty’s relatives live; we traveled around the western part of it for about six months. Thailand is where we got stuck for the past two years and is kind of our home now.

    summary:
      'Analogue photography is the method and the tools mostly popular amongst amateur and professional photographers up until the early 2000s. Today it is still used by millions of artists and hobbyists who appreciate or feel fascinated by the process and the results. Analogue, when taken within the context of technology, means signals of a variable quantity. To make things a little simpler I will explain what analogue means for sound transmissions first, before moving on to a slightly more complex imaging technology. Let’s begin.',

Hence we use processors to convert physical “reality” (signals) into information (most of which is math/data) that computers can easily manipulate. Just imagine how much easier and faster it is to use Photoshop than it is to edit images in the dark room (a lot easier and a lot faster).',

    summary:
      'After testing out my charity shop film cameras with Kodak ColorPlus — because that was the only film they had in my local Tesco — I wanted to give monochrome a go. So I bought some Ilford Pan 400 — a film that seems common in Asia but unavailable in the US or the UK — and did exactly that. The main project for the rolls was shooting a trip to my better half’s home town, which I did. You can see how that went here. In the meantime, I’d returned to Shanghai with half an unshot roll still in the camera, which meant I could get some bonus photographs of what is really now my adopted home town.',
